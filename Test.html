An online shopping website, also known as an e-commerce platform, is a digital storefront where customers can browse, select, and purchase products or services directly from a seller over the internet; users navigate through a virtual catalog, add items to a "shopping cart," and securely complete their purchase by providing payment details, with the goods typically delivered to their chosen address, offering convenience and access to a wide range of products 24/7, often with features like product filtering, customer reviews, and personalized recommendations
